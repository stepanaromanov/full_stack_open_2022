## [Full Stack Open 2022](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

### [Part 0 - Fundamentals of Web apps](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0)

In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the practicalities of taking the course. After that we will have an overview of the basics of web development, and also talk about the advances in web application development during the last few decades.

- General Info
- Fundamentals of Web apps

### [Part 1 - Introduction to React](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1)

In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the React-library, which we will be using to write the code that runs in the browser. We will also look at some features of JavaScript that are important for understanding React.

- Introduction to React
- JavaScript
- Component State, event handlers
- A more complex state, debugging React apps

### [Part 2 - Communicating with server](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2)

Let's continue our introduction to React. First, we will take a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. After this, we will inspect how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. Next, our focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. Lastly, we will take a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our React applications.

- Rendering a collection, modules
- Forms
- Getting data from server
- Altering data in server
- Adding styles to React apps

### [Part 3 - Programming a server with NodeJS and Express](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3)

In this part our focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. We will implement a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database. At the end of this part, we will deploy our application to the internet.

- Node.js and Express
- Deploying app to internet
- Saving data to MongoDB
- Validation and ESLint

### [Part 4 - Testing Express servers, user administration](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part4)

In this part, we will continue our work on the backend. Our first major theme will be writing unit and integration tests for the backend. After we have covered testing, we will take a look at implementing user authentication and authorization.

- Structure of backend application, introduction to testing
- Testing and backend
- User administration
- Token administration


### [Part 5 - Testing React apps](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part5)

In this part we return to the frontend, first looking at different possibilities for testing the React code. We will also implement token based authentication which will enable users to log in to our application.

- Login in frontend
- props.children and proptypes
- Testing React apps
- End to end testing


### [Part 6 - Advanced state management](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part6)

So far, we have placed the application's state and state logic directly inside React components. When applications grow larger, state management should be moved outside React components. In this part, we will introduce the Redux library, which is currently the most popular solution for managing the state of React applications. We'll learn about the lightweight version of Redux directly supported by React, namely the React context and useRedux hook, as well as the React Query library that simplifies the server state management.

- Flux-architecture and Redux
- Many reducers
- Communicating with server in a redux application
- React Query, useReducer and the context
